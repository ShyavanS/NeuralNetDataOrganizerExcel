# NeuralNetDataOrganizerExcel
A Python script to organize sensor data obtained from a potentiostat in the form of an excel file for use in a neural network.

The data is fed to it in .xlsx format collected from a potentiostat measuring pH sensor data and outputting to a computer to be logged. The script then takes this and organizes it such that it would be useful to a neural network model looking at the data for patterns.
